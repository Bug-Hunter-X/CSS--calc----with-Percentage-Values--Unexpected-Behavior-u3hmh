Instead of relying solely on percentages within `calc()`, consider using fixed values or a combination of fixed and percentage values to guarantee accurate results.  Alternatively, if the percentage depends on the parent, ensure that the parent's dimensions are clearly defined before the child element's dimensions are calculated.  You may need to adjust the order of CSS rules or add explicit width/height properties to parent containers.
